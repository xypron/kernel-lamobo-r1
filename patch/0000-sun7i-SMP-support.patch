Subject: [PATCH 0/2] sun7i: SMP support for the Allwinner A20 CPU

This patch series adds SMP support for the Allwinner A20 CPU.

It makes following changes in the device tree:

  * add address range for the CPU configuration registers
  * define an enable-method for the CPU

It supplies the smp_boot_secondary and smp_prepare_cpus
routines.

The code does not support hot-plugable CPUs.

The code is based on a prior proposed patch series

and code in https://github.com/linux-sunxi/linux-sunxi by
